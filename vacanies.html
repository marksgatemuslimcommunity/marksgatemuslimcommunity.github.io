            1. Introduction and General Terms
            <br/>
            The Marks Gate Muslim Community (MGMC) is dependent on the generosity of its supporters as well as the
            goodwill
            and trust of the public. We are therefore committed to protecting any personal information we obtain about
            you, whether you are just visiting our website or are a financial supporter, member of our congregation,
            volunteer or campaigner. This Privacy Policy sets out how we obtain, use and protect any personal
            information you provide to us, whether online, via phone, text, email, in letters or in other
            correspondence.
            <br/><br/>
            This privacy policy explains the following:
            <ul>
                <li>what information MGMC may collect about you;</li>
                <li>how MGMC will use information we collect about you;</li>
                <li>when MGMC may use your details to contact you;</li>
                <li>whether MGMC will disclose your details to anyone else;</li>
                <li>your choices regarding the personal information you provide to us; the use of cookies on the MGMC
                    website
                </li>
                <li>and how you can exercise your choices in relation to those cookies.</li>
                <li>MGMC is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Whenever you provide such information,
                    we are
                </li>
                <li>legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of
                    personal
                </li>
                <li>information, including the Data Protection Act 1998.</li>
            </ul>
            The MGMC website contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party
            websites have their own privacy policies, including policies on their use of cookies, and we urge you to
            review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit or which is collected by cookies
            whilst visiting these websites. We cannot accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices
            of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

            <br/><br/>
            2. Who we are
            <br/>
            Marks Gate Muslim Community Ltd is a charity (1174585)
            registered in England & Wales. Registered Office: 82-92 Whitechapel Road, London E1 1JQ

            <br/><br/>
            3. What information will MGMC collect about me?
            <br/>
            When you contact MGMC to make a donation or sign up to any of MGMC's activities or online content, such as
            newsletters, competitions, or you telephone, email, write to or text MGMC, or engage with MGMC via social
            media channels, we may receive and retain personal information about you. This can consist of information
            such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number, bank account details to
            process donations and whether or not you are a tax payer so that we can claim gift aid.
            <br/><br/>
            By submitting your details, you enable MGMC (and where applicable any of our projects) to raise funds and to
            provide you with the goods, services, information, activities or online content you select.
            <br/><br/>
            We do not usually collect "sensitive personal data" about our supporters, e.g. health status, unless there
            is a clear reason for doing so - such as participation in a âfundraising runâ or similar fundraising event
            or where we need this to ensure that we provide appropriate facilities or support to enable you to
            participate in an event. Clear notices will be provided on applications for such events so that it is clear
            what information we need and why we need it.
            <br/><br/>
            If you are simply browsing our website as an anonymous visitor, MGMC may still collect certain information
            from you, such as your IP addresses (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific
            computer or other network device on the internet).
            <br/><br/>
            MGMC also uses cookies. Cookies are small text files on your device. They are made by your web browser when
            you visit a website. Every time you go back to that website, your browser will send the cookie file back to
            the website's server. They improve your experience of using a website, for example, by remembering your
            preference settings and by measuring your use of a website to ensure that it meets your needs. See Section
            10 below for more detail on how we use cookies and how you can control your cookie preferences.

            <br/><br/>
            4. How will MGMC use the information you collect about me?
            <br/><br/>
            MGMC will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>in relation to any correspondence you have entered into with us whether by letter, email, text,
                    social
                </li>
                <li>media, message board or any other means;</li>
                <li>for "service administration purposes", which means that MGMC may contact you for reasons related
                    to
                </li>
                <li>donations you have made or the activity or online content you have signed up for;</li>
                <li>for internal record keeping;</li>
                <li>to fulfil sales/advertising contracts you have entered into with MGMC;</li>
                <li>to contact you about any content you provide;</li>
                <li>to invite you to participate in surveys or research about MGMC or our projects/services
                    (participation is
                </li>
                <li>always voluntary);</li>
                <li>for marketing purposes where you have specifically agreed to this (see below);</li>
                <li>to provide you with information about our activities or online content you have agreed to receive;
                </li>
                <li>to personalise the way MGMC content is presented to you;</li>
                <li>to use IP addresses to identify the location of users, to block disruptive use, to establish the
                    number of
                </li>
                <li>visits from different countries;</li>
                <li>to analyse and improve the activities and content offered by the MGMC website to provide you with
                    the most
                </li>
                <li>user-friendly navigation experience. We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that
                    no
                </li>
                <li>individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/><br/>
            5. Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?
            <br/>
            MGMC will only contact you for marketing purposes by email or other electronic means if you have agreed to
            be contacted for these purposes or where you have made a donation by text and have not opted out from
            receiving further information. Where you have provided your postal address we may send you direct mail about
            our work unless you have told us that you do not wish to receive such information.

            <br/><br/>
            6. Will MGMC share my personal information with anyone else?
            <br/>
            We will only use your information within MGMC for the purposes for which it was obtained, unless you have
            explicitly agreed that we may share your information with another organisation.
            <br/><br/>
            We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for
            example to government bodies for tax purposes or law enforcement agencies for the prevention and detection
            of crime, subject to such bodies providing us with a relevant request in writing).

            <br/><br/>
            7. Offensive or inappropriate content placed on the MGMC website
            <br/>
            If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content to or anywhere on the MGMC website, or
            social networks, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any MGMC networks, we may use your
            personal information to stop such behaviour.
            <br/><br/>
            Where MGMC reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any of the laws of England and Wales (or
            the law of Scotland if you live there) (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), we may use
            your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, internet provider or law
            enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

            <br/><br/>
            8. How long will MGMC keep my personal information?
            <br/>
            We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity,
            e.g. we will keep a record of donations for at least seven years. If you request us not to send you
            marketing information we will keep a record of your contact details and appropriate information to enable us
            to comply with your request not to be contacted by us.
            <br/><br/>
            Where you contribute material to us, e.g. user generated content or in response to a particular campaign we
            will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it
            was submitted unless otherwise stated at the point of generation.

            <br/><br/>
            9. What is MGMC's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personal information?
            <br/>
            The accuracy of your information is important to us. We are working on ways to make it easier for you to
            review and correct the information that MGMC maintains about you. In the meantime, if you change email
            address or any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, you can let us know:
            <br/><br/>
            through our website or
            email us at mgmct2013@gmail.com, or write to Fundraising Officer.
            Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about
